# Arboviral disease record data - Dengue and Chikungunya, Brazil, 2013–2020

This work presents a unified data set with clinical, sociodemographic, and laboratorial data on confirmed patients of Dengue and Chikungunya, as well as patients ruled out of infection from these diseases. The data is based on case notification data submitted to the Brazilian Information System for Notifiable Diseases, *Sistema de Informação de Agravo de Notificação* (SINAN), from 2013 to 2020. The original data set comprised 13,421,230 records and 118 attributes. Following a pre-processing process, a final data set of 7,632,542 records and 56 attributes was generated.
